This is an example of a cross platform mobile app.
This uses Kotlin multiplatform and Compose multiplatform to share all UI and back-end logic.

Notably, the architecture also keeps all significant logic out of the front-end, so it can be tested entirely on the back-end.
I need to fill out the docs for a more thorough explanation of how this works and the reasoning behind it.
